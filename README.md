# Executive Summary 
Travlr Getaways wants to develop a travel booking website for their customers to book travel packages. Their customers must be able to create an account, search for travel packages by location and price point, and book reservations with the travel agency. Customers must also be able to visit the website regularly before their trip to see their itineraries. Lastly, Travlr Getaways would like an admin-only site where their administrators are able to maintain a customer base, available trip packages, and pricing for each item and package. The marketing department at Travlr Getaways has provided the specs and a wireframe to guide the development of the website. Our goal is to produce a fully functional travel web application that meets Travlr Getaways’ requirements. 

To fulfill these requirements, we have begun using the single-page web app architecture of a full stack web application that uses the MEAN stack. MEAN stands for the essential full stack tools: MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. We will first need to map out the architectural components, set up the development environment, and customize the customer-facing web page to align to the wireframe provided and Travlr Getaways’ vision. This includes completing the initial setup of the Node.js server and the Express framework. The application will be a static customer-facing (frontend) website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements that each provide the visual aesthetics of the application. This includes the layout, style, design, and functionality required to meet the clients’ needs. 

To facilitate and optimize the application's building, we will complete the client single-page application (SPA) using the Angular framework to extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. We chose the Angular web application framework because it offers many fully integrated tools to facilitate the build. An example would be the Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) that can be used to build the components and services for the client-facing frontend. One of the most important steps throughout the process will be the addition of security features to protect the data of Travlr Getaways and their customers. In addition, Travlr Getaways wants to add a layer of security that applies to server-side applications to produce web tokens for web-login authentication. Once complete, a final testing on the full stack web application with the API to ensure the server is returning the data properly will be required.  

To code the backend of the application, we will need to create and configure a NoSQL database with data models and a schema for data files and storage. Using the MongoDB program, we will be able to store travel booking trips and create JSON files containing initial data for seeding the database to enable testing of the RESTful API routes. Next, we will populate the database and be able to view the seeded collections and documents within. Lastly, we will need to wire the database to the server, test the RESTful API, and refactor the code to work successfully with the frontend. 

# Design Constraints
The development and integration of the MEAN stack of software applications into a customer-facing and administrator single-page application could be a major constraint. Specific skills and a technical understanding related to web development and management, the interaction between its components, the development environment, and the applications’ optimization will be required. As the software stack uses an open-source framework, the source code is readily available to view and edit for developmental purposes. As we are using the MEAN stack, knowledge and proficiency in developing applications using JavaScript and exchanging data with JSON pose technical constraints. The addition of a layer of security that applies to server-side applications will also pose a technical constraint, mostly when producing web tokens for web-login authentication. 

A web server is essentially a system on which a website runs; It works by sharing a website’s information with any browser that requests it and is permitted access. Web servers hold a lot of private information, such as usernames and passwords, that will be stored in the database. This would be a technical constraint when storing and protecting the database and its interactions through the RESTful API as a specific set of skills and knowledge are required to develop secure communications between services. Several solutions exist to mitigate the vulnerability of the application, each providing a different design constraint. Such solutions include performing consistent website backups, hardening the wp-config.php file, and disabling the XML-RPC protocol. Backups enable developers to save their website’s latest data in the event of a break-in or file corruption. Hardening certain PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) files can protect the database from SQL Injection attacks, while disabling the XML-RPC protocol can prevent DoS (Denial of Service) Attacks.
